      <h2> The Creator</h2>
      we ask, <em>"if all things have a creator, then who created God?"</em> actually, only created things have a creator, so it is not proper to lump God with his creation. God has reveled to us in the bible as self exitent being.<p> however, Atheist counter that there is no reason to assume the universe was created.</p>

    <h2>Who Named God</h2>
    <p>looking into the Bible, God gave names to some special characters, but <strong>Hagar</strong> was the only character in the Bible to name God: El Roi, which means <em> the God who sees me.</em> </p>
    <h3> People Named By God</h3>
    <p> Names are an important part of our existence. We use them every day, in all of our communications with others.</p> But a precious few have actually been given their earthly names by God himself. Here are a few of those, as found in the scriptures:
    <ol>
      <li>Adam</li>
      <li>Abraham</li>
      <li>Sarah</li>
      <li>Isaac</li>
      <li>Ishmael</li>
      <li>Paul</li>
    </ol>
    if you look in the <strong> Bible</strong> you would understand that there are very few who was named by God. the reason was that most of this people had a great destiny to full fill, some of them showed and undying love for God. Nowadays, many christain do not know how to love God. they claim to love God but only do that with their lipsink.
    <h4> Ways to Express Love For God</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Walk in all his ways</li>
      <li>Keep his Commandments</li>
      <li>Cleave Unto Him</li>
      <li>Serve Him With all Your Heart and With all Your soul</li>
      <li>By studying his word (The Bible) </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>The Bible</h5>
    <p>overtime people have been debating on who wrote the word of God (the bible). some say it was written by men through the inspiration of the holyghost, while others say "God wrote ther bible "The Holy Spirit moved prophets like Moses and apostles like Paul to write about God’s relationship with the world ( 1 Ti 3:16; 2 Pe 1:20–21 ).</p> There are strong bible scholars who argue that the word of God has been in exitence before the creation of Man. There argument is based on the passage of the bible John 1:1-3 which states and i quote, <blockquote> "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 The same was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made."</blockquote> the word of God is divided into two parts;
